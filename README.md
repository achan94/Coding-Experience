# Coding-Experience
In this repository, I post some of programming projects I worked on in the past. As of now, What I posted are mostly codes I created in C++. These codes were run in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.There is only one Matlab file I created to demonstrate forecasting using Holt-Winter's method.
